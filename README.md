starting from [here](https://itnext.io/how-to-handle-the-post-request-body-in-node-js-without-using-a-framework-cd2038b93190?gi=a9dcabd27fe3)

moving to [formidable](https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable)

### Install

If you have docker installed and make, then use the makefile:

`make`  will both build and run the docker image locally

### Testing

There is an upload script that uses curl:

`./upload my_title ~/Pictures/file-to-upload.jpg`
